          <b>for clients,</b> GTrends is an easily digestible way to help
          clients plan their own marketing campaigns after DTP ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>for Leadflow,</b> GTrends would be a supplementary tool that
          informs when to redirect attention to seasonal clients. Very poor at
          local SEO, phenomenal at identifying long-tail and rising keywords.

          Drag your mouse across this datamap to see when these keywords peak in
          usage. You should notice a clear seasonal trend in September; this is
          especially significant given how the trend is present pre- &
          post-pandemic, demonstrating long-term viability of the service.

            GTrends is built to be user-friendly. even for folks with less tech
            proficiency, GTrends boils down to:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>insert search term</li>
            <li>adjust date range</li>
            <li>specify location</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            combined with live-updates, this is the closest a regular user can
            come to being "up-to-date on trends" in Google
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            after DTP is over, clients will still need marketing! GTrends offers
            a simple macro-level solution to determine when owners need to
            invest or divest energy from marketing efforts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>

            Tool can rapidly over-complicate if client doesn't know how to
            search for keywords, or know what they're supposed to look for.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            is "yet another tool" that client may not need... e.g., what if
            they're not seasonal? what if their actual customer base behaves
            differently than GTrend data?

            it's free, it's near-live Google results, and is especially helpful
            to analyze geographical trends in keyword interest.

            ge's own belief is that with the advent of AI implemented into
            search engines, SEO is headed towards a long-tail query golden age
            of asking high-intent queries rather than singular keywords. GTrends
            does great at identifying phrases, not just keywords.

            similar to client, knowing when to seasonally redirect energy
            towards certain clients to boost our KPI optimizes our time.
            Training time to learn GTrends is minimal; user-friendliness + clear
            documentation by Google makes onboarding smooth.

            Another tool in our kit means clearly establishing when GTrends is
            the "right fit". Especially if DTP grows, we need to minimize bloat
            at all corners-- especially with what tools we use.

            GTrends is ***terrible for local SEO.*** With an inability to
            specify counties/boroughs, GTrends falls especially short in NYC.
